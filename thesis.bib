  abstract = {Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modeling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}text\{SWAP\}\}\$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.},

The resulting solutions are obtained to a user-specified precision and the computational cost of applying all operators scales linearly with the number of parameters. The construction and use of separated forms for operators (here, the Green's functions for the Poisson and bound-state Helmholtz equations) enable practical computation in three and higher dimensions. Initial applications include the alkali-earth atoms down to strontium and the water and benzene molecules.},

  abstract = {Multiresolution techniques in multiwavelet bases, made practical in three and higher dimensions by separated representations, have enabled significant advances in the accuracy and manner of computation of molecular electronic structure. The mathematical and numerical techniques are described in the article by Fann. This paper summarizes the major accomplishments in computational chemistry which represent the first substantial application of most of these new ideas in three and higher dimensions. These include basis set limit computation with linear scaling for Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory with a wide variety of functionals including hybrid and asymptotically corrected forms. Current capabilities include energies, analytic derivatives, and excitation energies from linear response theory. Direct solution in 6-D of the two-particle wave equation has also been demonstrated. These methods are written using MADNESS which provides a high level of composition using functions and operators with guarantees of speed and precision.},
